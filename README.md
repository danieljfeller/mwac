# Web-based Snowpack Visualization Toolkit 
## Mt. Washington Avalanche Center

### Project Overview

![Data Flow](mwac_app_dataflow.png "Data Flow")


The Mt. Washington Snowpack Visualization App is a Python-based web application designed to provide an interactive and 
comprehensive view of the snowpack data collected by the Mt. Washington Avalanche Center (MWAC). This application integrates 
historical data from the Hermit Lake snowplot along with real-time field observations collected by the Avalanche Center 
staff, offering a valuable tool for researchers, climbers, and enthusiasts interested in the snow conditions of Mt. 
Washington.

## Features & Product Requirements

#### Product Features:
- **Interactive Data Visualization:** Utilizes Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive user interface.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Access to historical snowpack data from the Hermit Lake snowplot.
- **Real-time Observations:** Integration of current field observations by the Avalanche Center staff.
- **Customizable Views:** Options to filter and analyze data based on various parameters.

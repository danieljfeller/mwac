These winds appeared to be in excess of 30-40 miles an hour at times, even at the surface below treeline, and caused significant disturbance to the snowpack.  

The resultant blowing snow was difficult to differentiate from freshly falling snow, and the drifting which occured as it settled left the Gray Knob snow boards with a 1-2 cm depth of wind hardened crust. This crust, along with the decrease of total snow depth, suggests that the plot experienced scouring and net loss of snow and is not representative of those areas where snow was deposited. 

Early yesterday evening, temperatures rapidly rose from the high single digits below (⁰C) to above freezing, slowly returning to colder temperatures overnight.
